This document describes where Itara is going, not just where it is. It is
a living document.
 
Itara — the open-source specification and its reference implementations —
is the cornerstone of this vision, not the whole of it. Everything else on
this site describes what exists today, working, open source, and usable.
This page describes the future that today's Itara is the first step
toward.

## The north star
 
A production system should have a declared, validated, and executable
topology — how its components communicate and connect — that is easy to
change without touching business code, without migration ceremony, and
without downtime. And it should be able to do so safely: with the
confidence that the new topology is correct before it is applied, that
every connection is validated, and that nothing can be misconfigured
silently.
 
A future where developers build software, and the topology evolves
itself. Not a world where the topology of distributed systems is
programmed — a world where it's **designed**:
 
- **Design** — engineers draw topology in a visual editor.
- **Validate** — a controller validates every change and orchestrates deployment.
- **Observe** — the running system is continuously observed against the declared topology.
- **Evolve** — the platform safely recommends or performs topology optimisations.
Developers focus on business logic. The platform manages topology.
 
This is physically possible. What has been missing is the architectural
model that makes it real.

## The core reframe
 
Today, the topology of a distributed system — which components exist, how
they communicate, where they are deployed — is encoded in the system
itself. It lives in HTTP clients, message producer configurations,
service discovery calls, timeout settings, and retry policies scattered
across every service. Changing the topology means changing code.
Splitting a service means rewriting clients. Moving from HTTP to a
message queue means touching both sides. Architecture decisions made at
the start of a project calcify into the codebase.
 
Worse, topology is invisible. Nobody has the full picture. Changes are
made by reading code, making assumptions, and hoping the assumptions
hold. The system cannot tell you what it is. It cannot tell you what will
break if you change it. It cannot tell you if the change you just made is
correct.
 
Itara reframes this. Topology is not a property of the code — it is a
continuously adjustable variable declared in configuration and applied by
the wiring agent. Component logic expresses what a system does. The
wiring config expresses how the parts connect. These are different
concerns and they should live in different places.

## What Itara is not
 
Itara is a thin slice. It concentrates one specific concern — topology —
into an explicit and executable layer. The goal is not to own the stack
or replace what already works.
 
Container orchestrators own deployment, scaling, and scheduling. Service
meshes own network-level traffic policy between deployment units.
Observability platforms own how telemetry is stored, queried, and
visualised. Deployment tooling owns how software reaches production.
These are all solved problems with mature, well-understood tools. Itara
does not compete with them — it declares the topology that sits above and
between them, and eventually generates inputs for them from that
declaration.
 
What has no mature solution is the layer between architecture diagrams
and running systems — the layer where topology decisions are made,
encoded throughout the codebase as side effects, and then lost. That is
the layer Itara owns.
 
---
 
## The two pillars
 
Itara is built on two co-equal parts. Neither is sufficient without the
other.
 
**The wiring agent** makes topology a separate layer. It reads the wiring
config before the application starts, resolves all connections once,
wires the components together, and then steps aside. The application
runs at full speed with no intermediary, no proxy in the call path, no
decisions made at call time. The agent is language-specific — each
supported language has its own implementation — but the wiring config and
the component model are language-neutral.
 
**The tooling ecosystem** makes that layer safe and manageable. It
validates configurations before deployment, catches mismatches and
incompatibilities at authoring time, visualises the topology as a graph,
closes the loop between declared and actual topology, and guides
engineers through changes. Incorrect topologies cannot be deployed
silently. The layer Itara introduces is the layer the tooling understands
deeply.
 
The wiring agent moves complexity out of the code. The tooling takes
responsibility for that complexity. Together they make topology a
first-class engineering artifact — declared explicitly, validated before
deployment, and easy to change precisely because the system understands
itself completely.

## Pillar one: the wiring agent
 
### Zero overhead on colocated calls
 
When two components share the same process and type system — for example,
two JVM components wired as `direct`, or two Rust components loaded as
separate dynamic libraries in the same process — the agent resolves a
proxy at startup. At call time, that proxy calls the implementation
directly. There is no serialization, no network hop. Nothing happens
that isn't strictly necessary for the call itself — this is a design
commitment, not an aspiration.
 
For components colocated on the same host but running in separate
runtimes — such as components written in different languages — the
developer declares the local IPC mechanism in the wiring configuration.
The runtime uses exactly the mechanism declared and nothing else. No
network leaves the host. No transport decision is made autonomously by
the agent.
 
### Startup resolution, not call-time decisions
 
The agent's job is finished before the first request arrives. All
proxies are resolved, all connections are established, all SPIs are
loaded. There is no application server sitting between components. There
is no sidecar intercepting calls. The wiring happens once. The
application runs free.
 
This is what makes topology change safe to reason about: the state of the
system is fully determined by the wiring config at startup time. There
are no runtime surprises, no lazy connection establishment, no decisions
deferred to call time.
 
### Language-specific, specification-neutral
 
The agent is implemented separately for each supported language,
following the idioms and capabilities of that language. The separation of
topology from code does not vary. See [Language agnosticism](#language-agnosticism)
for the full picture.
 
---
 
## Pillar two: the tooling ecosystem
 
### The topology compiler
 
The primary authoring and validation tool is a CLI that understands the
system deeply — which components exist, what contracts they implement,
what serializers and transports they support, what versions are
compatible. It validates every connection in the wiring config before
deployment: API contracts, serializer compatibility, version ranges,
dependency completeness.
 
This is the compiler for distributed system topology. It takes intent,
validates it against what the system actually contains, and produces a
verified artifact. A topology that does not pass validation does not
deploy. Incorrect configurations are caught at authoring time, not
discovered in production.
 
The same validation logic is meant to eventually power a visual editor:
engineers draw topology on a graph, the tool validates each connection in
real time. The CLI and the UI would be the same engine with different
rendering layers — everything checkable in one, checkable in the other.
 
### The controller
 
Above the compiler sits the controller — the intelligent layer that
observes the running system, builds a model of its behaviour, and
recommends or executes topology changes.
 
The trust ladder governs how much autonomy the controller is granted:
 
1. **Self-service** — engineer decides, tooling makes it cheap and reversible
2. **Recommendations** — controller suggests with reasoning, engineer approves
3. **Prepared actions** — one button, fully described, reversible
4. **Full automation** — opt-in, scoped, with kill switches and full audit trail

The controller never operates opaquely. Every recommendation is
explained. Every automated action is logged and reversible. Trust is
built on transparency, not on promises.
 
### The long-range vision
 
The tooling direction extends further than configuration authoring. As
the system matures, the tooling becomes capable of reasoning about the
entire lifecycle of a distributed system: validating that a topology
change is safe before it is applied, predicting the effect of topology
changes on observed behaviour before they are applied, and eventually
enforcing that the actual topology matches the declared topology — the
same control loop that infrastructure-as-code brought to servers — and
driving automated topology decisions that the engineer approves rather
than initiates.
 
The long-range vision: a distributed system that can recompile its own
components with updated contracts, redeploy them with a new topology, and
verify the result — all driven by the same tooling that started as an
interactive CLI. Not autonomous in the sense of opaque, but autonomous in
the sense of tireless, consistent, and always verifiable.

## Built-in observability
 
Observability is not an afterthought in Itara — it is a structural
property of the architecture. The agent intercepts every call between
components at startup. That interception point is the natural place to
collect latency, throughput, error rates, and transport overhead without
any instrumentation burden on the developer.
 
Every connection in the topology graph has events attached to it
automatically. Engineers can see not just the structure of their system
but how every connection behaves — latency, errors, and transport
overhead, without writing a single line of monitoring code.
 
This observability is also what makes the controller trustworthy. Before
automation is ever enabled, the engineer can watch the controller's
reasoning against real data and verify that it is correct. A system that
cannot be observed cannot be safely automated. Itara treats these as
inseparable requirements.

## The wiring config as a graph
 
The wiring config is a directed graph. Nodes are components. Edges are
typed connections. The same component can be reached by different
callers via different connection types. This is the data structure the
tooling will reason about, the visualisation layer will render, and the
engineer will eventually plan graphically.
 
Today the wiring config is a file — a practical entry point for a system
at its current scale. As systems grow to hundreds of components and
thousands of connections, the backing store will evolve: a document
store, a graph database, a relational schema, or something not yet
decided. The agent always works from a concrete configuration snapshot,
but where that snapshot lives and how it is managed is an operational
concern.

## Language agnosticism
 
Itara is not a Java project. Java is the first reference implementation.
Rust is the second. More languages follow.
 
The specification defines the component model, wiring model, transport
interface, observability model, and context propagation contract. Any
language with sufficient metaprogramming or build-time automation
capability — whether through macro systems, bytecode manipulation,
annotation processors, or dynamic class loading — can implement the
specification. The interface definitions will eventually be replaced by
a language-neutral descriptor — components in any language participating
in the same topology graph, producing the same distributed traces.
 
The Rust implementation proved language agnosticism is not aspirational.
The same wiring config switches a Java gateway from calling a Java
calculator to calling a Rust calculator. The distributed trace shows both
spans. The code changes nothing.

## The mathematical foundation
 
Individual components can be modeled as queuing systems. Composition
follows Network Calculus — the same cumulative formulation, extended to
arbitrary topologies with worst-case delay bounds. The goal: predict the
effect of a topology change before making it, the way an engineer
analyzes a circuit before building it.
 
This mathematical work is a research direction, not a committed
implementation plan. If it lands, it becomes the foundation for the
controller's predictive reasoning — the difference between a tool that
validates topology and a tool that optimises it. Academic collaboration
is the realistic path for taking it from theory to a runtime the
controller can use.
 
---
 
## Why now
 
The microservices explosion has made the operational pain acute and
universal. Kubernetes and Terraform have trained engineers to think in
external controllers and declarative topology. Rust makes native agent
libraries practical without GC overhead. Academic work on queuing models
and feedback control of computing systems has existed for decades
without a practical application to pull it into production use.
 
Itara is the missing application.
